Technologies Used: Our project employs a robust tech stack including PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and MySQL. PHP ensures dynamic data processing, while HTML and CSS contribute to the user-friendly interface. JavaScript enhances interactivity and a smooth user experience. MySQL acts as the backend database, ensuring secure data storage and retrieval. <br />

Efficient Data Management: With the integration of MySQL, our system ensures secure and structured storage of crime-related information. The relational database design facilitates seamless data manipulation, reporting, and analysis. <br />

Responsive Design: Our user interfaces are designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring optimal performance across various devices and screen sizes.<br />

We believe that efficient crime record management is crucial for effective law enforcement, and our "Crime Record Management System" project is a step in that direction. By combining cutting-edge technologies and a user-centered approach, we aim to revolutionize the way crime data is handled and analyzed. We invite you to explore, contribute, and collaborate to make our criminal justice system more effective and data-driven.<br />
